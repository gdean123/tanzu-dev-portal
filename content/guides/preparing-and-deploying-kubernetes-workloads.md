Deploying to Kubernetes can become somewhat of an involved process, but it's also one that can be instrumented in a way that may be better than what you're running today. While writing YAML files 100's of lines long can be tiresome, there are tools that help ease or even completely remove the process. Additionally, there are features of Kubernetes that you can leverage in your application to improve their performance and operation.
